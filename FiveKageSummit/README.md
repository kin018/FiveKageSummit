# 5 Kage Summit - Emergency Citizens' Conference

## Overview

The 5 Kage Summit is an emergency conference convened for citizens to be addressed by the leaders of their respective territories, known as the Kage. This summit serves as a platform for the Kage and their bodyguards to discuss critical matters affecting their territories and the state of the world. In this year's summit, we have chosen Tokyo, Japan as the venue instead of the Land of Iron due to safety concerns. The primary focus of this summit will be on matters pertaining to the enigmatic and dangerous organization, the Akatsuki.
