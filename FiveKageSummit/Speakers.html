                        <h2>Gaara</h2>
                        <h5>The Fifth Kazekage</h5>
                        <h5>About Gaara</h5>
                        <p>Gaarais a shinobi of Sunagakure. He was made the jinchuriki of the One-Tailed Shukaku before he was born, causing the villagers of Suna to fear him as a monster. With nobody to connect to, Gaara grew up hating the world and looking out only for himself, giving his life meaning by killing anyone he came across. After being defeated by Naruto Uzumaki a jinch?riki like himself who found strength in his friendships  Gaara starts emulating him. He becomes Suna's Fifth Kazekage so that he can protect the village and all those who live there, dispelling the fears he cast on the villagers.</p>
                        <p>Having been trained since infancy as Suna's "ultimate weapon", Gaara was exceptionally strong even as a child, effortlessly killing the countless assassins sent after him. As a genin, he became known internationally for completing B-rank missions. He also set the record time of completing the Ch?nin Exams in the Forest of Death, and unscathed;a feat normally incapable for a ch?nin.[19] By Part II, Gaara becomes Suna's Fifth Kazekage, tasked with leading and protecting the entire village. </p>
                        <p>His fellow Kage initially doubted his worthiness due to his young age, but come to respect him by the Fourth Shinobi World War, where he was appointed the commander-in-chief of the Allied Shinobi Forces' combat divisions.[20] The reincarnated Kage that Gaara fights, including his father, also come to approve of his abilities after he defeats them.[21] He could hold his own against five of Madara Uchiha's Susanoo-clad wood clones for some time. As an adult, Gaara's prowess had grown to the point where he could hold his own against opponents of the Otsutsuki Clan. Fighting alongside Shukaku, he was able to hold off and eventually seal Urashiki temporarily while in battle. Gaara has large reserves of strong chakra, a fact Akamaru recognises even before Gaara has performed any technique. His chakra levels are partly because he is the jinch?riki of Shukaku, but even after Shukaku is removed from his body in Part II, there is no noticeable difference in his performance. In battle, Gaara tends to stay away from his opponents and rarely uses taijutsu. In the anime, he acknowledges this as a shortcoming and therefore trains with Shira to improve his abilities.[22] Kinshiki ?tsutsuki regards Gaara's taijutsu as being on par with Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Darui, stating that their skill in this particular style of combat. His nature transformations include Earth, Lightning, and Wind Release,[5] the latter of which he often mixes with his sand in order to increase its speed and coverage area. In Gaara Hiden, Gaara is shown to have inherited the Magnet Release kekkei genkai from Rasa, which he avoids using in battle so that he can have it as a last resort that opponents won't know about. He can use his Magnet Release to increase the density of his chakra and sand, thereby strengthening his defences. As Shukaku's jinch?riki, Gaara is able to manipulate sand. He carries a supply of sand wherever he goes in a gourd, which itself is made from sand. This personal sand is infused with his own chakra, allowing him to deploy it faster and manipulate it more precisely. If he needs more sand, he can either use sand from the surroundings or, if there isn't any, use his personal sand to break down minerals in the ground to create some;[24] these secondary sand supplies require more chakra to control. Gaara's ability to manipulate sand remains even after Shukaku is removed from his body. Indeed, upon seeing how much sand Gaara can control at once, the Fourth Kazekage wrongly assumes it is Shukaku itself doing so. Gifted with powerful defensive ninjutsu, Gaara's usual tactic is to remain stationary in battle, using his sand to attack opponents from afar. The attacks typically follow the same formula: capture and immobilise the target, such as with the Sand Binding Coffin, and then crush all parts of their body, such as with the Sand Waterfall Funeral. If opponents are able to get close enough to attack him, Gaara's Shield of Sand automatically protects him from all threats, even those he is not aware of; the Shield of Sand is commonly thought to be Shukaku's doing, an act of self-preservation, but it is actually Gaara's mother, Karura, whose love protects Gaara even after her death.[26] If the Shield of Sand is penetrated, either through speed or brute-force, Gaara also has access to a secondary Armour of Sand covering his body; however, it requires an impractical amount of chakra to maintain for long periods of time and weighs him down.[27] Nevertheless, Gaara's sand is extremely effective at keeping him safe, earning fame as an "absolute defence" and allowing him to go years without experiencing a single injury. By adulthood, Gaara's Shield of Sand's defence increased tremendously, able to shrug off attacks that Sasuke Uchiha's Majestic Attire: Susanoo could not. Gaara's sand is highly malleable and can be used for any number of purposes. Often this is to protect others, such as with a wall for one person or, in his capacity as Kazekage, a shield as large as Suna.[29] Offensively, he can shape Sand Shuriken or Sand Swords. Gaara also has a variety of supplementary uses for his sand: a form of flight for himself and others; a method of sensing concealed targets; a Sand Clone to reinforce himself or allies; a Third Eye for reconnaissance. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he uses the Desert Layered Imperial Funeral Seal to serve the same functional purpose as the Cloth Binding Technique, giving him a way of stopping reincarnated opponents.</p>

                <section class="speaker" id="onoki">
                    <div class="col-2-3">
                        <h2>Onoki</h2>
                        <h5>The Third Tsuchikage </h5>
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h5>About Onoki</h5>
                        <p>As the Third Tsuchikage, ?noki was easily one of the strongest shinobi Iwagakure ever produced. At over 80 years old, despite his considerably advanced age leaving his general health somewhat frail (constantly complaining about back and hip pain), he still proved able to lead his village with no waving doubt of the people. In battle, he still proved very capable, able to compete against various powerful foes including his reincarnated former master. He was well-regarded as a legendary shinobi,[23] as Madara himself acknowledged ?noki as the main threat among Allied Shinobi Forces and the most difficult to break.[27] At full strength, he could wipe out twenty-five of Madara's Susanoo-clad wood clones.[28] Ultimately, at over 100 years old, his advancing age forced him to retire and mostly stay in a wheelchair. Even more, he required several more hours of sleep a day to keep up his health and strong exertions like ninjutsu could tire him out enough to pass out. At the same time, he still proved to be as quick-witted and skilled as ever.[23]</p>
                        <p>?noki was able to use Earth, Fire, Wind, Lightning, and Yang Release.[1] By combining the first two, he could use Lava Release,[29] and by combining the first three elements, he could utilise Dust Release. With the kekkei t?ta, he could pulverise a target to dust. The second shinobi in existence with the ability, ?noki's Dust Release was quite powerful, capable of destroying an entire island reputedly,[30] and a massive forest in one blast.[31] He could alter the size and shape of his Dust Release technique, able to split it down the middle.[32] ?noki could also lock a fast moving target within the shape of his Dust Release to defend his village from a meteor shower.[33]</p>
                        <P>?noki also showed great prowess with Earth Release. He could create rock clones and massive golems to aid him,[34] as well as manipulate the terrain. ?noki also wielded Earth techniques that manipulate gravity, allowing him to increase or decrease an object's weight, letting him restrict a target's movements with the former and lift Genbu with the latter. He could also fly by decreasing his own weight. To make up for his lack of physical strength, ?noki could cover his fist in rock to increase his striking power and further increase the weight it to penetrate strong defences. These techniques could also affect chakra-based substances, such as a Susanoo.[34]</P>

                        <h5>The Fifth Mizukage </h5>
                        <h5>About Mei</h5>
                        <p>Mei Terumi is the Fifth Mizukage of Kirigakure. After the dreadful reign of Yagura Karatachi ended, she became Mizukage and worked tirelessly to reform internal policies and recreate diplomatic relations with other villages.</p>
                        <p>Mei is proficient in the nature transformations of Water, Fire, Earth, and Lightning Release.With Water Release, she can create a large torrent that can extinguish a powerful Fire Release technique used by Madara Uchiha, and quickly use the same water to form a giant dragon. Mei can also use the Hiding in Mist Technique to obscure the movements of herself and her allies.[12] Two years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, her mastery of Water Release enabled her to successfully protect her village from the massive meteorites that had broken off from the falling Moon. Mei also possesses two elemental kekkei genkai, the first of which is Lava Release. By combining the earth and fire natures, she can spit out acidic mud that can melt almost anything in its path. The great amount of steam generated after the fluid strikes can serve as an effective smokescreen, allowing for a follow up attack while the enemy is distracted.[15] A significant amount of exposure was enough to partially melt Madara's Susanoo ribcage. The second kekkei genkai, Boil Release, allows her to simultaneously use water and fire natures to release a corrosive mist that can melt almost anything it touches. It even managed to burn through Sasuke's Susanoo ribcage. She also has the ability to alter the potency and acidity of the mist created by her Boil Release techniques, and is apparently not affected by the mist herself.</p>

                <!-- Danzo -->
                <section class="speaker" id="danzo">
                    <div class="col-2-3">
                        <h2>Danzo Shimura</h2>
                        <h5>The Sixth Hokage</h5>
                        <p>I AM A TEMP HOKAGE AND I AM THE MOST HATED CHARACTER IN THE SHOW</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <h5>About Danzo</h5>
                        <p>As the leader of the Root and the Sixth Hokage Candidate, Danz? was an exceptionally powerful shinobi. Danz?'s skills were held in high regard by the elders Homura and Koharu as they considered him one of Konoha's strongest ninja, even up until his death.[37] His power was such that Kakashi expressed intense shock upon learning that he had been defeated single-handedly by Sasuke Uchiha. However, this defeat was partly attributed to his old age, his holding back for most of the fight to fight Tobi, and being unable to use Shisui Uchiha's Mangeky? Sharingan. Despite all this, however, Danz? was still able to fight evenly with Sasuke throughout their battle, despite the latter's excessive use of his Mangeky? Sharingan, and dealt him a potentially fatal wound.</p>
                        <p>Danz? was adept in both using and dispelling high-level genjutsu, even from powerful Sharingan-users like Sasuke. He also had some skill in taijutsu and a decent amount of physical strength despite his old age, being able to repel Karin with one kick.[38] Danz? was also quite fast and agile as he was able to catch Sasuke off-guard and, in the anime, was able to evade a large amount of debris falling on him. Additionally Danz? was also skilled in the use of kenjutsu, as seen against the Prajñ? Group.</p>
                        <p>Danz? was well-versed in the use of f?injutsu and cursed seals. To prevent his secrets from being exposed, Danz? placed binding seals on the tongues of every Root member. Should a Root member speak openly of Root and Danz?'s activities, the seal would activate and instantly paralyse the member's body. The seals vanished when Danz? died. Danz? could also implement binding seals in battle, which was shown when he placed the seal on Sasuke, temporarily paralysing him. Lastly, upon his death, Danz? revealed his most powerful sealing technique, the Reverse Four Symbols Sealing. The technique caused four seal symbols on Danz?'s skin to exit from his body and forms a large sphere around him. Everything inside the sphere was then drawn in and imprisoned within his corpse. After the sealing was complete, the seals could still be seen on Danz?'s body.</p>
                        <p>Danz? had access to a very unique summoning, a giant tapir-like creature known as a Baku, described as the "Nightmare-Eater". A creature of massive size, it had the ability to suck in objects and targets within the area in front of it. The Baku's suction could also be used to increase the power of Danz?'s wind techniques. However, using the suction left the creature vulnerable against fire techniques.</p>
                        <p>Danz? could utilise multiple nature transformations which included Wind, Earth, Water, and Fire Release, as well as Yin and Yang Release.[2] He was particularly proficient in Wind Release, exhaling powerful vacuum-based attacks that could either slash like blades or pierce like bullets. If needed, he could use enhanced or localised variations, some of which were strong enough to destroy an extremely durable wooden dome or damage a humanoid Susanoo's defences.[23][39] Danz? could also use his wind chakra to manoeuvre himself in mid-air, as well as infuse wind into his weapons to increase their offensive power.</p>
                        <p>Possessing the First Hokage's cells in his right arm granted Danz? the ability to use Wood Release, albeit with a significant toll on his chakra. This combined, with the fact that his overall skill with this technique was quite rudimentary, prompted him to only use it when necessary. It also appeared that he could only use the Wood Release from his modified right arm although he could do so without using hand seals. However, after suffering a fatal wound in his battle against Sasuke, Danz? lost control of Hashirama's cells, which began to rapidly grow into a large tree that threatened to engulf him completely.</p>
                        <p>Danz?'s right arm originally belonged to Shin Uchiha and was implanted with ten Sharingan and was enhanced with Hashirama Senju's DNA. Ao also noted that the colour of the chakra in his right arm was also that of Shisui's.[40] He normally kept the arm hidden under bandages and a gauntlet-like seal, presumably to conserve chakra and keep the eyes and DNA in check</p>
                        <p>Due to integration of Hashirama's cells, Danz? also gained the shinobi's ability to heal nearly any wound without the use of hand seals.[41] According to Tobi, Danz?'s possession of both Uchiha and Senju DNA most likely meant that he was after Naruto, since he possessed the potential capability to control Kurama.[42</p>
                        <p>Danz?'s right eye was that of Shisui Uchiha's Sharingan, though, in the anime, Shisui's was not the first Danz? possessed. Nevertheless, he was very skilled at using it, able to detect multiple assassins hidden among his surroundings[43] and subdue individuals with genjutsu. Danz? could activate Izanagi, a technique forbidden even amongst the Uchiha clan. When activated, Danz? temporarily gained the power to turn his own body into a physical illusion, which could nullify any injury he received from an opponent. This allowed him to survive otherwise fatal attacks while retaining the ability to inflict physical harm to his opponent. Izanagi gave him another benefit; after being "killed", Danz? would appear elsewhere away from danger.</p>
                        <p>Although he could not see through or use the passive abilities of the Sharingan embedded in his arm, he was able to make extended use of the technique. Combined with the added stamina granted by Hashirama's cells, every 60 seconds Izanagi remained activated, Danz? would lose the use of one of his Sharingan. As this was still not very long, with ten Sharingan implanted in his right arm giving him up to ten minutes' worth of Izanagi, he could break its usage in between as he chooses.[44] Obito explained that this length of time is due to the former's lack of mastery over Hashirama's cells.[45] Also, even with Danz?'s physical energy augmented by Hashirama's cells, it still took a substantial amount of chakra to sustain the technique.</p>
                        <p>Having his eye constantly hidden, Danz? has never been depicted activating Shisui's Mangeky? Sharingan. Despite this, he had made use of Kotoamatsukami, through which he could manipulate other people's thoughts without them being aware of it. Because Shisui's Mangeky? Sharingan circumvents the need to make eye-contact to activate its techniques,[46] Danz? manipulated Mifune's thoughts without exposing it.[47] Because Kotoamatsukami is not a technique that can be used regularly, he had openly stated that it was not an ability he could use multiple times a day.[48] Augmented by Hashirama's cells, Danz? could actually use it once every several hours, as opposed to once every decade.[49] Though, he had expressed interest in increasing his ability to use it more frequently believing that Orochimaru's data could help.[50] Upon his death, Danz? destroyed the eye in fear that it could one day be used against Konoha.</p>

                        <h5>The Fourth Raikage</h5>
                        <h5>About A</h5>
                        <p>As the Fourth Raikage, A is an extremely powerful shinobi, being chosen as the Supreme Leader of the Allied Shinobi Forces, even after losing his dominant arm. His signature fighting style combines the elements of ninjutsu and taijutsu to form nintaijutsu. Using it, he could easily directly engage in battle with a tailed beast, defeat a fully transformed J?go, and overwhelm a Mangeky? Sharingan-wielding Sasuke</p>
                        <p>A is naturally quite fast, able to intercept an opponent before they realise he has approached them.[24] Until Naruto Uzumaki,[25] A proclaimed to be the world's fastest shinobi since Minato Namikaze's death.[26] A also possesses an enormous amount of strong chakra, comparable to that of a tailed beast, according to Karin.[27]</p>
                        <p>A has enormous physical strength. Using only a single hand, he can lift a massive, two-handed barbell; smashing through walls;[28] severing one of the Eight-Tails' horns;[29] and breaking through Susanoo, an "absolute defence".[30] While possessing powerful and extremely fast punches, A prefers to use wrestling-style moves rather than standard taijutsu, such as powerbombs, backhanded chops, take-downs, and leg drops.</p>
                        <p>A inherited his father's immense durability, having survived being transported by Mabui's Heavenly Transfer Technique unharmed.[31] His pain tolerance is high as well, as he didn't even flinch from cutting off his own arm to keep the black flames of Amaterasu from spreading.</p>
                        <p>A's nature transformations include Lightning, Earth, and Water Release.[1] His signature technique is the Lightning Release Chakra Mode. By encasing himself in lightning chakra, his physical parameters and thought processing are greatly enhanced. While already formidably fast on his how own, his raw speed and reflexes become comparable to Konoha's Yellow Flash.[33] Even the Sharingan had trouble tracing his movements.[34] This speed allows him to create after-images, and evade point-blank attacks, such as J?go's multiple-cannon blasts and Amaterasu.[35][36] Also, A's durability is enhanced to the point of withstanding otherwise fatal blow with no more than a small cut.[37] His already massive strength becomes just below that of Tsunade.[38] Alternatively, he can collaborate his Lightning Release with a Water Release user to power up their technique with lightning to add the effect of electrocution and paralysis.[</p>

                        <h2>Mifune</h2>
                        <h5>The Leader of the Land of Iron and Moderator of the summit</h5>

                        <h5>About Mifune</h5>
                        <p>As a master samurai, Mifune is undoubtedly powerful in battle. As the general of the samurai, Mifune has command of the rest of them and, by extension, is a highly capable leader. An adept thinker, Mifune has also shown a sharp memory, able to anticipate and properly counter enemy tactics he has not seen in decades as showed against Hanz?. Despite his old age, Mifune has also shown great agility as shown from jumping high into the air to reach Sasuke and moving with incredible speed to attack Hanz? before he could form hand seals.[4] He also seems to have built up a tolerance to Hanz?'s poison since the two have clashed in their youth.[5] Even during his youth, Hanz? claimed Mifune was strong enough to force him to keep his mask on on the chance his venom sac was ruptured. In the anime, Mifune proved to be a skilled teacher, having trained personally Tsubaki Kurogane.[</p>
                        <p>Mifune is a master swordsman who wields the katana "Kurosawa" (??, Kurosawa, literally meaning: Black Swamp). He is widely renowned as a master of Iai — a style of swordsmanship which involves the user rapidly unsheathing his blade to slash the enemies, and then re-sheathing it after completing the attack. Mifune's mastery of Iai is such that Hanz? and others have stated how it was useless to try and perform hand seal-induced techniques against him, due to the fact that Mifune is capable of closing the distance and attacking within the short time it takes to make the necessary hand seals.[2] The speed and precision of his strikes are able to inflict a lethal blow on his opponent without staining the blade with blood, and even slice open the head of a large summon creature such as Ibuse.</p>
                        <p>Due to his extensive knowledge of swordplay, Mifune can judge the weaponry skill of his opponents, telling how potent or diminished the opponent's skills are, after a single clash. Like his subordinates, he is also capable of channelling chakra through his sword to increase its cutting power or send a wave of chakra with a swift swing of his sword as a powerful long-range attack.[7] In the anime, his precision was even able to cut off a lit candle's wick and keep it lit on the edge of one of his swords,[8] stop his attacks at a moment's notice,[9] produce shock-waves from his strikes to intercept enemy attacks and channel electricity through his blade by use of a battery to defend against Earth Release users.</p>
